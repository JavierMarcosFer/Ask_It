This is a web-based Javascript application created in 2019 that allows a user to become the host of a room. Attendants who join this room can then anonymously 
  ask questions to the host, as well as vote on questions other attendants have posted. The host can then look at 
  these questions and delete them from the list as they are resolved. The questions are sorted by number of upvotes.
  The list regularly and automatically refreshes to add newly asked questions and update the upvotes on existing questions. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 To use this program, hosts and attendees alike must first create an account. Then they may enter their credentials to log in.
 The slider below allows users to toggle whether they wish to log in as a host or as an attendee.
 </p>
 <p>
When a host logs in, the server will automatically provide and display a unique code for that room. Attendees may then enter this code
to join the room, enabling them to post questions to be displayed on the host's screen. Hosts are encouraged to show their display to their
attendees, which will display incoming questions.
</p>
<p>
Attendees can upvote any questions posted to their room. Questions will then be regularly and automatically sorted according to the number of
votes. This allows for important questions that attendees are most interested in to be rise to the top of the list, and ideally, be resolved first.
